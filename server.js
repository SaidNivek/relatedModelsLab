// express.static helps express find where certain files are located

app.use(express.static('public'))

// method override middleware
// convert a get/post request to a delete (or put) request
app.use(methodOverride('_method'))

// body-parser middleware -> intercept the data from our post request
// take all of the data in the url-string content and create an object - req.params 
// request body -> data - parsed by the middleware

// CONTROLLERS 

app.use('/products', controllers.products) // "products" router
app.use('/reviews', controllers.reviews) // reviews controller
// additional controllers can be added here. These controllers will handle requests for other resources (transactions, users, auth, landing pages, etc)

/* 
    EXPRESS Routing: express provides route methods that will intercept requests to the server:
    1. filter by method - app.get will only run if the type of request has a GET method
    2. match the url path argument - a requested url from the client - if a match is found a call back function is called
    3. the callback function - provided two arguments by express representing data/methods concerning the request and the response. 
        3a - request {} - a request object provides information about the request made by the client
        3b - response {} - a response object is a collection of properties / methods. 
        3c - response.send() - a response method that closes response cycle -> send back info/data to the browser
    
    Note: A response method call is required for every request otherwise the server will "hang" and timeout after 30-60 seconds

/* 
    EXPRESS Server: initializes the server; app.listen allows your computer to receive requests at http://localhost:4000/
